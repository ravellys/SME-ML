## Estimating Soil Moisture and Actual Evapotranspiration with Machine Learning

Routine to estime the soil water content by GaussianProcessRegressor in Caatinga area. We train the model with data  of the soil moisture and the precipitation cumulatede in 7 days (P7). Thereafter, the data is simulated with the initial moisture (tho) and P7. The data used in this work was provided by the project INCT-ONDACBC (Observatório Nacional da Dinâmica da Água e de Carbono no Bioma Caatinga)
The soil moisture was evalueted by TDR sensors in depth of 10,20,30, and 40 cm. This tower is located in a seasonal tropical dry forest (Caatinga) in the semi-arid region of Brazil (Serra Talhada - PE). (http://dx.doi.org/10.17190/AMF/1562386)
